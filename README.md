### Back End

* Express server to handle the api/html routes as well as connecting to our database. 

* MySQL database that holds our users as well as all the merchandising routes.

* [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/) to handle sessions and authenticate users with **Node.js**

* Bcrypt.js to encrypt user passwords and allow for extra security.

### Front End

* Bootstrap to help with popups such as modal's and the navbar

* HTML5 in conjuction with CSS3 to make the site mobile and desktop responsive as well as creating a polished UI. 

### PWA

* QuickMerch has been made a Progressive Web App through the use of a **service worker** and **webmanifest** allowing the website to cache necessary files. 

### Deployment 

QuickMerch has been deployed on Heroku with the domain registered under Google Domains. Heroku has also provided an SSL Certificate allowing for even more security when accessing the site.
